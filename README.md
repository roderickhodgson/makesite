## Introduction

Makesite is a simple python script for creating a template HTML5 web page and associated javascript and css files inside the current directory, in one quick command.

I made this to be able to quickly try out frameworks and tools that tickled my fancy, without having to look up standard HTML5 templats, or downloading bootstrap, etc.


## Installation

``python setup.py install``


## Use

from within the directory you wish to create the html index.html file, run ``makesite [page title]``
